# Instructions
Tv Series search

The assignment is to create a web application that makes it possible for a user
to search for information about TV Series using the TV maze API. The TV maze
API has a public API which can be used for this assignment, and you can find
information about it here: https://www.tvmaze.com/api
The project should show the search results in a list and allow the user to see
more information about the show in another view.
The expected time frame for this assignment is about ~5 hours. Try to limit
your work to that timeframe and document in a readme file what you would
have done if you had more time.
The web application will be judged according to the code readability and
structure.

Figma Sketches
Feel free to use the sketches found on the link below as the visual look of the
web application.

Requirements
The web application must include the “required” requirements. Add the “Nice
to have” requirements if time permits. Before you start, read through the
whole list so you get a good understanding on what to build.
Required
• The web application should be responsive and work on both mobile and
desktop.
• The web application must work on the latest version of the browsers
Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
• The web application should have two views, one for detailed information
and one for search and result.

• The repository of the web application must contain documentation on
how to run the application.
• The web application should be written in JavaScript or TypeScript and in
the framework of your choice.

Nice to have
• The web application is written in TypeScript.
• The web application is written in ReactJS
• The web application is written without CSS libraries and frameworks.
• The web application should give the end user feedback concerning errors
or when the connection to the API is slow. For example, when they have
a slow internet connection.
• The web application should have routing set up in such way that the end
users can send direct links to detailed information about a certain TV
show.
• The project should have tests.
• If time permits, feel free to add what you think is missing from the
application.
